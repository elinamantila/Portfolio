                <p><br>The assignment was to build a prototype of an online flea market. The idea was to build a flea market that would work like a regular flea market, that is, the user can browse tables and products created by different sellers. It should also allow you to bargain for the price between the seller and the buyer.
We designed two different types of paper prototypes as simple as possible so that we could add or remove functionalities as needed during testing. Based on the feedback we received, we reinforced some of our hypotheses and started to build a digital prototype using HTML + CSS + JS + Bootstraps. <br> We build the prototype to work only on mobile.

        <h2>What I learned during this project</h2> <br>   
        
<p><b>Paperprototyping is essential.</b> Through this project, I realized the importance of testing different options with simple methods before making the actual functional prototype. It is much easier to change the paper prototype than to modify the technical implementation. When testing a paper prototype, you should boldly jump out of the idea of digitalisation and test out different user paths. Now we tried to replicate the computer screen on paper.</p>
             
<p><b>Donâ€™t fall in love with your idea.</b> I learned to leave out a great idea that I loved but just didn't work with user testing. </p>
    <p>
<b>Make hypotheses.</b>The most important lesson, however, was to make hypotheses, to express them, and to use test data to build the service. Careful preparation simplifies the creation of the actual prototype and final product.
