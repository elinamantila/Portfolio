                <p><br>The purpose of this project was to improve a digital service chosen by our team. We decided to take part to develop tori.fi -service. We conducted a survey and interviews, which formed the basis for the new service concept.
We conducted a survey using Google Forms. Based on the data we collected we came up semi-structured questions for interviews. The data obtained from the interview were processed by affinity analysis. And based on these, we created user personalities and scenarios that helped develop the new concept. Our concept covers the service only in the browser, otherwise the concept would have expanded too much.

        <h2>What I learned during this project</h2> <br>   
        
<p><b>Always remember to take photos.</b>We didnâ€™t remember to take pictures of each step of the way and it was difficult to document the steps afterwards.</p>
             
<p><b>Be careful what you ask for.</b> Creating interview questions was challenging because the questions should be in a format that encourages the respondent to talk about the issue rather than answering with just one or two words. The questions must be unambiguous and language understandable. </p>
    <p>
<b>Remember to edit. </b>When thinking about a new concept for a service, you need to decide on a time limit and determine what can be done within that timeline. This service has a lot of different features and we tried to get everything to fit into the concept.
